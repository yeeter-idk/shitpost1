  <p>She is great because she is cute, wholesome (unlike a certain <image class="icon" src="Hanako.png">), innocent, and strong. </p>
  <p>Very strong 😎</p>
  <image class="preview" src="Beautiful_Day_Dreamer_Animation_Scene_59.png">
  <p> She loves everybody and she is a hero to me and everyone around her, doesn't matter that she is an android and a little autistic but that's what makes her cute. Her name is "Aris" but she calls herself "Arisu", its a very cool detail. She has a cool futuristic rail gun she calls "Sword of Light: Supernova", it's crafted by the Engineering Department, and graciously gifted it to our girl Aris. </p>
